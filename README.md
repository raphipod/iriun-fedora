# iriun-fedora
Iriun Webcam as a RPM package

## Installation:

Install it on Fedora with the following command:

`sudo rpm -Uvh (PACKAGE_NAME) --force`

**Note: This force-installs the package and may cause issues with updates or while installing
other programs with rpm/dnf. If that happens, just uninstall iriunwebcam and reinstall it
after the update/program.**

Tested functional on Fedora 37 and 38.

Latest deb version of Iriun: 2.8.1
